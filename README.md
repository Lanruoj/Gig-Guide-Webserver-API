## **1. Identify problem to be solved**
***

As a passionate music lover who doesn't use social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, it has become increasingly difficult to keep up to date and know what's happening in my local music scene. But even when I used those platforms, the smaller "word-of-mouth" shows (that usually produce the most magical moments) would often be obscured or not posted at all. Facebook in particular typically relies on the musical act, the venue and/or an events/ticketing company to publish a show - I would like to propose a platform for the *punters* to share upcoming shows with each other with a focus on community spirit - the heart of music.

## **2. Why is it a problem that needs solving?**
***

For a long time social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have dominated the “events” category for local music scenes. But people are increasingly withdrawing from social media for various reasons, which can make staying in the loop difficult in a digital world. Bands still need exposure and people still need to know where they can get their music fix, so a public and free local gig database can solve these problems in an environment that doesn’t have some of the less desirable side effects of social media.

## **3. Why have I chosen PSQL? Pros/cons, compare to others**
***

I have chosen PostgreSQL as my *database management system* (DBMS) because it as well as being the focal database system used in class, it is free, open-source offers all the features I need for the project. Another option would have been MySQL, which is also open source and potentially offers faster performances and is easier to use, however PSQL supports more advanced features, such as the `CASCADE` deletion event constraints, the `EXCEPT` query clause to filter search results and the ability to store complex data objects such as arrays.
